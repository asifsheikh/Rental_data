Female flatmate required for sharing from October 1 in Koramangala
7,000 - Koramangala

Looking for a 3rd female flatmate for a beautiful semi furnished 2BHK near Lifestyle (Sony Signal, Koramangala). 

We have found this huge flat with modular kitchen for which we will take the possession from first October. The house has proper ventilation and has lift. It is extremely spacious with huge wardrobes and light and in case of power cuts there back up too.. Its a semi furnished 2BHK and you need to share the room. We will plan and decide on the furnishings only once we have the 3rd person in..Fridge, gas connection and WiFi are available.

Price structure: We plan to keep a maid and a cook. The salary will be shared, in addition to the rent along with wi-fi, electricity and gas cylinder.
Rent: 7K
Deposit: 40K 

Rules: No smoking no drinking in the house..! We are pure vegetarians and would need a vegetarian flatmate,preferably North Indian.
We just expect good hygiene and would prefer a working lady. No pets allowed.

Please inbox/comment if interested.

PS- we want to close it early so that the 3rd girls name can also be on the agreement
