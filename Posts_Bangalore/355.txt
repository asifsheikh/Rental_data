One semi-furnished room with bathroom available on individual basis in a 3 BHK 2200 sq. ft. apartment on Lavelle road. What I like about the flat, is the large and spacious drawing room, attached balconies with each room and a great location of the flat. It is at walking distance from UB City, Cubbon Park, Church Street, St. Marks road and MG Road Metro station.

Costs involved:
Rent/person: Rs 14,500/month (includes maintenance cost)
Security deposit: Rs 70,000/person
Kitchen appliances, washing machine, refrigerator and other costs: Rs 10,000/-

Cleaning servant and internet costs are separate.

There are no interference from landlord. 

I have attached the pictures of the flat and the room.
