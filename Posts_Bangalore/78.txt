Flatmate wanted in a 2-BHK
16,000 - Indiranagar, B'lore

A room is available on the 2nd floor of a fully furnished (bed, sofa, fridge, power backup, gas, oven, utensils, geyser, air conditioner, washing machine, the works) stand-alone house, from October 7th 2017 as my friend is moving out. The location is prime Indiranagar (200m from The Humming Tree, 500m from Vapour) and suitable for anyone who works nearby or spends an inordinate amount of time partying here. An added benefit is exclusive access to the lovely roof - to bask in the morning sun, or swoon to some groovy music with friends in the evening. The rent is 16000 INR plus utilities & maids (comes to a total of almost 20000 INR) a month. There is also a deposit of INR 75000 involved.

PM me if interested. Please refrain if this isnt in your budget, as there isnt any flexibility in the rent or deposit amounts.
