Room for Rent in a beautiful house in Indiranagar (females only)
18,000 - Indiranagar

We have a room available for occupation starting October 1, 2017 in a beautiful house in Indiranagar.
After spending a year in this house with a wonderful flatmate (Tanisha Prakash) and getting happily used to the comfort and convenience of this place, with a heavy heart I'm moving out because work comes calling. 
The cupboards and the bathroom fittings (also the awesome world map on the wall!) come with the house. The room has an attached bathroom. We've furnished the house with all things of need. The rooftop is beautiful and worthy of a special mention because you will end up using it a lot for parties or hosting events (talking from experience, you see.). 
It also has a gym with all equipment. The management is very helpful and cooperative, and the landlord non-intrusive.
The location is walking distance from the coveted 12th Main Road, convenient distance from M.G. Road, Koramangala and all the other hip places (Whitefield is not hip. Come on!).
So if you have a bed and a set of curtains for the bedroom (or if you're willing to buy them), in need of a place that's clean, close to the party neighborhood, and/or enjoy playing musical instruments or trying your hand at painting, and you're a no-interference, no-bullshit person, please contact me or Tanisha.
Here are a few pictures to help you get a sneak peek into our lovely abode.
