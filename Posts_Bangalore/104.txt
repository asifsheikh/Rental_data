Hey Guys,

I'm going to be shifting to Bangalore this month end. I would need a 1bhk apartment in the Jayanagar/JP Nagar/BTM Layout areas that I can occupy from 1st October. My sister and I would be staying together and hence need a place which is safe and secure. I am also open to take up a room for double occupancy in a 2/3bhk where girls are already staying.
I would typically be looking at a place which has no restrictions with respect to timings or people visiting since I work with a startup and have erratic working schedules.
Do hit me up if you have any leads. Any and every kind of help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Cheers!

Edit - I will probably need to move in by 15th-17th Oct now. Thanks.
