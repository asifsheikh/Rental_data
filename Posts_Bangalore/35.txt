Flatmate required on Immediate basis in a 2BHK Flat in BTM 2nd Stage
5,375 - BTM 2nd stage

Looking for a chilled out roommate on sharing basis (guy/girl - doesn't matter but preferably north indian) in a 2bhk flat in BTM 2ND Stage, that doesn't hold you back on your creativity, on immediate basis.
We are 3 crazy guys who love rains as much as rajma chawal or masala dosa. Believe in creating moments by either doing woodwork, playing carrom, photography, traveling, or just bak-bak.
We practice minimalism hence we don't have TV but have Netflix for you to chill  and a good internet 50 Mbps connection.
There is a cook and maid for doing basic chores. However, the maid gets cranky at times if we make too much of a mess so we all "try" to keep the house clean.
There is 24*7 open big terrace for you to find solitude or watch stars.
