Hola!

I'm vacating this amazing room, only because I work at BTM and I figured I can't spend half of my life at Silk board traffic anymore. 

But girl, lucky for you if you are looking for a place! This room is available for single occupancy(or double if you have a female friend along with you) from October 1st. The house is located at 19th main, hsr layout. 

Facilities include:

Fully set up house with equipped kitchen, internet, washing machine, maid and cook.

A cozy and nice terrace for chilling 

Own garage for 4 wheeler/2 wheeler parking

Kaveri water

Inverter for power back up

The room has a kick-ass dressing table and two big wall cupboards, and bathroom with geyser

Expenses: other than rent, monthly expenses including internet, maid, cook, groceries will come upto around Rs. 7000.

Deposit: 60k (it's worth it)

DM if you are interested!
