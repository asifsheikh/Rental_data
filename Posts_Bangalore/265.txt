2 BHK flat on rent in Kodihalli - No Brokerage, Only for families
21,000 - Bangalore, India

Posting on behalf of Owner,
Are you looking for a 2bhk, which is a walkable distance from 80 feet road - Indiranagar, Jeevanbeema Nagar road, or hardly 700 mts away from Leela Palace / Manipal Hospital? All the necessities you might require are available at a stone's throw (away) distance, provided you through that stone harder. :P When you know its weekend and who cooks on weekend, you will find a lot of famous food joints around.

Its a single building apartment, with three flats on each floor. This one is available on the second floor, which one can easily climb up through the stairs or there is lift also for the little lazy ones. There is power backup in the common area, while you are welcome to install an inverter for inside the house. There is no disturbance from neighbors as most of them are leading busy working lives. This flat is full of cupboards everywhere, that you might want to buy extra stuff to fill in some of them. We also use the small balcony cum utility for washing clothes and watering plants.

Want to visit the place? A direct message would work, and commenting is the default action. (happy house hunting)
