Hi.

I am looking for my replacement in a 2.5 bhk. The room is shared by two people. As I am moving out the new person will be sharing this room with the existing tenant.

The place is in the heart of the city - National Games Village, Koramangala. The flat is fully furnished with 24/7 water facility in a gated community. The house is very big and spacious with wooden work done. Room has one attached balcony as well.

Rent is Rs3000. 
Deposit - Rs34000. 
Maintenance per person is Rs 1060. 
Cook and maid available and that cost is extra. 

The room is available from 01.10.2017.
