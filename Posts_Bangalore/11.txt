Looking for a replacement for me in a 3BHK apartment at NCC Maple heights -mahadevpura.  Girls only.
9,600 - Bangalore, India

I'm vacating a room in a 3 bhk at NCC Maple Heights. It is single sharing in each bedroom so totally 3 occupants in the house. It's a beautiful mid sized apartment with amenities such as swimming pool, gym, clubhouse etc that is well maintained and absolutely secure. Ola/Uber cabs available in plenty and the best part for air travellers - the route no.8 bus can pick you up right at the apartment gate !

Other two occupants are working professionals in the IT industry. The flat is very big - well lit and airy giving anyone who stays here a very positive vibe. It is on the 2nd floor and front facing. 2 kms from phoenix market city/VR mall.  

My room comes with a large wardrobe and dressing table. All other furniture visible in the pictures will be gone with me ! Rent is INR 9600 per month inclusive of maintenance. Deposit is INR 50,000. All other expenses such as maid, cook, internet is shared equally. 

Available from 1st November. 

Leave me your number in a private message if interested and I will call you back !
